# Kubernetes + OpenCTI + Splunk development environment
This repo hosts the `values.yaml` and related connector configuration files used in my blog post to deploy OpenCTI and Splunk in a local Kubernetes development environment using Minikube and Helm. It covers setting up OpenCTI with connectors and integrating it with a Splunk instance for bidirectional threat intelligence sharing.
